### Coding Projects in CPME255 DATA MINING

## Project 1

This project illustrates GitHub Copilot using a code sample in Python(copilot_sample.ipynb). The video of the illustration is [here](https://youtu.be/Ov0IqvViIhY).

- Create two lists, fruits and sales
- Use the lists to create a Pandas dataframe
- Show the top 3 sales values for each fruit
- Show a bar chart of average sales per fruit

Available in the [Copilot folder](https://github.com/shernee/01_cmpe255/tree/master/Copilot)


## Project 2

## Project 3

Illustration of AutoML using JADBio
- [Part 1](https://youtu.be/hVyJIiNdIik) involves selecting a dataset and analysing it. I have selected the 'Predicting potato quality using biomarkers' dataset and performed a classification analysis on it.
- [Part 2](https://youtu.be/i2w8F3B3BD0) involves applying a model on the dataset. In this case I have used the model to predict the quality of unlabeled samples in the dataset (potato_quality_predictions.txt) and also predicted the quality based on manually entered values.

## Project 4

Illustration of low-code AutoML using PyCaret and demo's of Multiclass Classification and Regression using Gradio

For Timeseries modeling I have used Pythons Statsmodels library, as I had package dependency issues with PyCarets Timeseries module

Available in the [PyCaret folder](https://github.com/shernee/01_cmpe255/tree/master/PyCaret)
