### Using Generative Augmentation to improve 'Learning from Crowds'

A typical classification problem is supervised, which means that it requires labeled data for the model to learn from. But for a real-world dataset it is very hard to find labeled data. One common way to solve this problem is to crowdsourcce the labels. To improve upon its disadvantages such as low-quality and sparsity, CrowdInG-**Crowd**sourced data through **In**formative **G**enerative augmentation framework is used. 

With the goal being accuracy of labels, the process aims not just to reflect the ground-truth but also be true to the distribution of crowdsourced labels. It is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS's) whch consist of two modules, the Generator and the Discriminator.

CrowdInG performs consistently better than state-of-the-art baselines such as Agg-Net and DL-MV among many others and thus proves to be an effective solution in the area of low-budget crowdsourcing.
